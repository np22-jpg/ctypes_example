# Modified Lab04
## Building the shared binary
First, run `cmake -G Ninja`. We use ninja instead of make because it is objectively superior in every way, shape, and form.
Then, actually build the binary with `cmake --build .`

## Running the notebook
Just run the notebook as per usual. There's nothing special.
